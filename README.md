## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-e-commerce-api.git
cd your-e-commerce-api
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:

Copy the provided `example.env` file and rename it to `.env`. Adjust the configuration settings according to your environment.

4. Set up the database:

Create a new database for the project and update the database connection details in the `.env` file.

5. Run database migrations:

```bash
npm run migrate
```

6. Seed the database (optional):

If you want to populate the database with some sample data for testing, run the following command:

```bash
npm run seed
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The API server will be running on `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can modify the port in the `.env` file.

## API Endpoints

Here are the main API endpoints:

- `GET /api/products`: Get a list of all products.
- `GET /api/products/:id`: Get a specific product by ID.
- `POST /api/products`: Add a new product.
- `PUT /api/products/:id`: Update a product by ID.
- `DELETE /api/products/:id`: Delete a product by ID.
- `POST /api/users/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/users/login`: User login.
- `GET /api/cart`: Get the user's shopping cart.
- `POST /api/cart/:productId`: Add a product to the shopping cart.
- `PUT /api/cart/:productId`: Update the quantity of a product in the cart.
- `DELETE /api/cart/:productId`: Remove a product from the cart.
- `POST /api/orders`: Create a new order.

## Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To access protected routes, include the JWT token in the request headers as follows:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

## Error Handling

Errors are returned in a standardized format. Example:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "status": 404,
    "message": "Product not found"
  }
}
```

## Testing

To run the tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```
